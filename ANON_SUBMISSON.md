# Anonymous Submission Notes

This repository is prepared for double-blind review. Please be aware of the following:

- All author names, affiliations, and contact details have been removed or replaced with neutral placeholders.
- Attribution to upstream projects (e.g., LIBERO, FoundationPose) remains where required to acknowledge public resources; these references do not reveal the identities of the submitting authors.
- Git history has been rewritten or initialised anew so that previous commits do not leak metadata.
- If you discover any identifying artefacts, please contact the submission chairs rather than the authors to preserve anonymity.

Evaluators can reproduce the experiments and inspect the code without compromising the double-blind process.
